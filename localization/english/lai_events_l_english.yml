 peru_bolivia_confederation.1.t2:0 "Desperate Times, Desperate Measures"
 peru_bolivia_confederation.1.d:0 "The Caudillos have submerged Perú in anarchy, the latest chapter in this tragic tale saw President Orbegoso's government reduced to controlling only the city of Arequipa and threatened from the north by Felipe Salaverry, former general inspector of the militias and now self-proclaimed Supreme Chief of the Republic, and from the south by General Gamarra who, after plotting with the president of Bolivia, Andrés de Santa Cruz, the conformation of the Peru-Bolivian confederation decided to march and take Cuzco without having formalized the pact."
 peru_bolivia_confederation.1.f:0 "Orbegoso, overwhelmed by the situation, got permission from congress to ask Bolivia to save him in exchange for allowing Santa Cruz to form a confederation between Perú and Bolivia as he pleased.\n\nThus, a little less than a year after the coup, the Bolivian army and the Peruvian forces loyal to Orbegoso have turned the tables. Gamarra is in exile after a shameful defeat on the battlefield and the territory controlled by Salaverry is limited to Arequipa and the Real Felipe fortress in Callao."

 peru_bolivia_confederation.2.t:0 "A Clean Board"
 peru_bolivia_confederation.2.t2:0 "The Price of the War"
 peru_bolivia_confederation.2.d:0 "The war is over!\n\nWith the defeat of Salaverry, Perú lies at the mercy of President Santa Cruz, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to unify the former territories of the viceroyalty and Tahuantinsuyo and make them the center of America as they were before and after the arrival of the Castilian men and shall be in the future"
 peru_bolivia_confederation.2.d2:0 "The war is over and the traitor Salaverry has been defeated! However, far from having reestablished the constitutional order, the wars have placed Perú at the mercy of the popular caudillo Santa Cruz who undoubtedly will seek to favor Bolivia over Perú"
 peru_bolivia_confederation.2.f:0 "With the confederation at our doorstep, it is up to him to decide what form it will take and if the experiment will be successful or perish before its enemies."
 peru_bolivia_confederation.2.a:0 "Let's get down to business"
 peru_bolivia_confederation.2.b:0 "Not only time will tell..."

 peru_bolivia_confederation.3.t:0 "The Fate of Perú"
 peru_bolivia_confederation.3.d:0 "Perú is not a homogeneous country. The southern populations have long lived in discontent, feeling subordinated to Lima's elites. This, together with the historical, geographical, and cultural separation from the north, has generated ideas of independence."
 peru_bolivia_confederation.3.f:0 "Now, Santa Cruz, a man of both Hispanic and Inca noble descent, has become a celebrity among Perú's underprivileged classes. This fame only gets more intense the further south you go. The yearning for independence away from Lima has been amalgamated with the popularity of the confederation project with Bolivia not only amongst the general population but also notables such as the influential cleric Luna Pizarro.\n\n "It is only fair to free them from the tyranny of Lima! … Besides, they would be a good ally if things ever go south with the north."\n\n "Haven't you heard of self-fulfilling prophecies!? If we split Perú things will definitely go south with the north!""
 peru_bolivia_confederation.3.a:0 "The Confederation's popularity will secure the loyalty of the new Republic!"

 peru_bolivia_confederation.4.f:0 ""...The peoples of the South, convinced by a long and sad experience, that their association with those of the North, under the unity regime, makes organization difficult, if not impossible, and for the same reason more difficult to archive happiness which essentially depends on the form of government...rise and form a new state free and independent under the name of the South-Peruvian State, adopting for its government the form of popular representation...""
 peru_bolivia_confederation.4.a:0 "¡Viva la independencia!"

 peru_bolivia_confederation.5.f:0 "“Considering…that it is in the interest of satisfying the wishes of the peoples, so manifestly pronounced by the confederation, accelerating the time of the new social organization of the three aforementioned States, and regularizing their relations with internal powers; Decree establishes the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, made up of the North-Peruvian State, the South-Peruvian State and the Republic of Bolivia." - ANDRÉS SANTA-CRUZ\n\nThe decree is sure to ruffle more than a few feathers, but we shall defend the union from any threat, may it be traitors from the inside or foreign enemies that fear our might! Let us reclaim our rightful place as the leaders of America!"

 peru_bolivia_confederation.6.f:0 "“Considering…that it is in the interest of satisfying the wishes of the peoples, so manifestly pronounced by the confederation, accelerating the time of the new social organization of the two nations, and regularizing their relations with internal powers; Decree establishes the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, made up of the Peruvian and Bolivian Republics." - ANDRÉS SANTA-CRUZ\n\nThe decree is sure to ruffle more than a few feather, but we shall defend the union from any threat, may it be traitors from the inside or foreign enemies that fear our might!

 peru_bolivia_confederation.7.f:0 "The Confederation's government will work in a similar way to the relationship between state governments and the federal government of the United States, but granting significant powers to the executive branch of the general government among which is a 10-year term with the possibility of immediate re-election for the Protector.\n\nBeing Santa Cruz the first Protector, he will have the task of consolidating the Confederation and defending it from her enemies to ensure that after his mandate is over, she stands established like any other state and not just a feeble relationship between countries."
 peru_bolivia_confederation.7.a:0 "This is where the fun begins"

  peru_bolivia_confederation.8.t:0 "The Andean Successor"
  peru_bolivia_confederation.8.d:0 "The Perú-Bolivian Confederation has endured for a decade despite the machinations of our rivals.\n\nWhat was once the ambition of Santa Cruz and many others among the past two nations now stands as firm as the giant stones of Sacsayhuamán."
  peru_bolivia_confederation.8.f:0 "The Andes are only a distant knife piercing through the evening sky from here. Their jagged blade, pale between the clouds.\n\n"We are successors of the Incas and the Viceroys, and as we were the undisputed rulers of the south so shall we reclaim our rightful place, a new power of a new era!""
  peru_bolivia_confederation.8.a:0 "We will shine brigther than our gold"
